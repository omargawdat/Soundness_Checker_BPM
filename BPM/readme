        pip install networkx
        pip install matplotlib

2. input:
    2.1 option:
        their are 3 inputs options you can change between them by changing the choice in this line:
        ""initial_marking, goal_place, edges = input_data(choice=3)""

        first 2 options are hard coded for making things more flexable:
        1. choice = 1: this option will show the first Example in the slides in page (35) lecture (PETRI NETS)
        2. choice = 2: this option will show another example

        to enable the user input and make it dynamic make it the choice 3.

    2.2 format:
        Initial place number
        Goal place number
        Number of edges
        Edges: the edges in the graph using this format P1 T2, by using just spaces between the the two node



3. Output Format:
    Soundness, Not Soundness
    Graph: the graph of the reachability graph
        goal: red
        start: green
